### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it introduced me to the course as well as introducing me to C++ as a language. I learned how to use return commands as well as a standard output command, the bread and butter of coding in C++. We went on to use those commands in every single lab from that day forward, so this lab was especially useful.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was my single favorite lab that we did during the course of the class. Lab 3 was especially interesting to me because I had never heard of a Julian Day before, let alone know how to use one. Not only did I learn how to use integers and standard strings in this lab, but I also learned something new about a way to tell the difference between different points in time.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was another one of my favorite labs. This was mostly because I had no knowledge on the subject of Blackjack before starting the lab. We learned how to use bool statements and went more in depth on the usage of if statements, and by the time I was done learning about Blackjack, I was interested enough to do research on the game on my own time.
